TODO:
patterns:
	creational patterns
		abstract factory: e.g. SAX/DOM-XMLParser
		singleton (with "getInstance"): e.g. DBConnectionPool
	structural patterns
		composite: e.g. for whole group (and/or tree) of objects - mark-up yellow
		proxy: e.g. remote/virtual/protection-proxy delegates methods to "actual" objects
			example "load-mem-cache...image"
		facade: e.g. "single point of access" (multifunctional device including print/scan/copy)
			see also "service layers"
	behavioural patterns
		template method: e.g. ruby/perl code generator
		mediator: e.g. for connecting "unrelated" objects (supporting complex communication)
		observer: e.g. for "decoupling" related objects
		strategy: e.g. internal optimised algos (situation/context dependent)
